# get-flutter-fire

Boilerplate for Flutter with GetX and Firebase

Use the git version history to learn step by step

Step 1: Use Get CLI https://pub.dev/packages/get_cli

`get create project`

Step 2: Copy code from https://github.com/jonataslaw/getx/tree/4.6.1/example_nav2/lib

Step 3: Integrate FlutterFire Authentication

- Tutorials [https://firebase.google.com/codelabs/firebase-auth-in-flutter-apps#0] for inspiration
- Firebase Documentation [https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/flutter/start]
- Blog [www.medium.com/TBD]
- To compile the code ensure that you generate your own firebase_options.dart by running

  `flutterfire configure`
  Step 4: Add Google OAuth [https://firebase.google.com/codelabs/firebase-auth-in-flutter-apps#6]. Note ensure you do the steps for Android and iOS as the code for it is not in Github
